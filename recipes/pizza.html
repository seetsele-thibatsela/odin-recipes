<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This classic pizza dish recipe has a nice crunchy crust with flavorful toppings, including pineapple that has a slight smokey flavor.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for pan</li>
    <li>2 slices applewood-smoked bacon</li>
    <li>4 canned pineapple rings</li>
    <li>1 pound fresh pizza dough, at room temperature</li>
    <li>½ cup pizza sauce (from 1 [14-oz.] jar)</li>
    <li>2 cups (8 oz.) pre-shredded whole-milk mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>¼ cup thinly sliced red onion</li>
    <li>3 ounces Canadian bacon (about 4 slices), cut into 1-in. triangles</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C) with a rack in the lower position. Oil a large rimmed baking sheet with olive oil.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high. Add bacon and cook, flipping occasionally, until golden brown and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
    <li>Pour out pan drippings without wiping pan clean, and return skillet to heat. Add pineapple, cook until lightly browned and caramelized, 3 minutes per side. Remove from pan. Chop bacon and cut pineapple rings into 3/4-inch pieces.</li>
    <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll dough to a 12-inch circle and place on the oiled baking sheet. Prick dough with a fork several times to reduce air bubbles. Spread pizza sauce evenly over dough, leaving a 1 1/2-inch border around edges. Sprinkle with cheese, onions, Canadian bacon, pineapple, and chopped bacon.</li>
    <li>Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbly, toppings are lightly charred, and crust is golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.</li>
